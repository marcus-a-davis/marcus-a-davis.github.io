        My impression of DBC is mostly unchanged from watching the video. From everything I'd previously read and learned about DBC I expected the type of environment in which students are encouraged to push themselves, other students and the instructors in new ways when they are learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fact that the curriculum is constantly changing and feedback is heavily encouraged is a good example of this. DBC probably wouldn't really work if each student came in solely focused on learning the "right" way to do things and inwardly focused only on themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am very much excited to work in this type of environment because I think this type of open culture will get the most out of me as a programmer. I think I'll learn much about working with people which is a big part of working professionally as a programmer. Further, I look forward to helping and encouraging others. I fully expect there to be some subjects where I may know a bit more than others and some where others may know a bit more than me. I already frequently interact in groups where this is precisely the scenario and we all use it to learn from each other. So instead of seeing every interaction as a personal competition, I tend to see them as an opportunity to improve myself and explain myself to others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If anything about DBC makes me nervous, it's not so much this type of working environment as it the pressure I'm going to put on myself to succeed. You have to realize at the outset that there will be struggles but intellectually recognizing this before and responding well in the moment are different skills.
