<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was great. While our wireframes ending up being quite similar, it was very helpful to talk to someone as I was working through the creation of it. The same is true for the HTML. Thinking through the design decisions would have been pretty straightforward even without a pair but doing so while having someone there to offer feedback helped. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
It was somewhat helpful to wireframe. I imagine as your projects and designs get more complex it will be much more useful to wireframe.


What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We thought the basic elements of a functional and attractive wireframe for a website was pretty limited, particularly given the limited design elements we were implementing. Having a wireframe that covered these basic elements and served as a reference point to check your html against to see if you were missing anything you thought was needed covered what we thought made a wireframe useful.


What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

We used 'nav' and 'aside' with which I'd had effectively no experiecne implementing on my own. 'nav' is used for easily tagging and altering your navigation bar in css and 'aside' is similarly used to box elements to one side of the page.
