            <h1>What is Positioning in CSS?</h1>
            
          <p>
      If you're new to working with CSS elements one of the most basic
      and important things to learn is to get them to show up one the
      page where you want them to. The most basic way CSS enables you
      to do this is with the positioning attribute. There are four
      possible settings of positioning: static, relative, fixed, and
      absolute.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are basically what their names suggest. By default, all HTML
      elements are set to static positioning. This means they are not
      affected by top, bottom, left or right properties (these properties
      move elements by reference to the top, bottom, left, and right
      edges of the page). Relative elements, by contrast, do respond
      to top, bottom, left and right. They are moved relative to what
      their position would be if you'd left them with the default of static positioning. Moreover, other elements are not adjusted to
      fill any gaps created by relative elements. It's like not having
      your text wrap around a picture in a word processor.
    </p>

    <p>
      If, for example, you wanted to have the main content of you page
      spaced in relation to the header at the top of the page, relative
      positioning would be great.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="../imgs/eaforum-sidebar.png" width="100%" height="auto">
      <figcaption>A good example of a scrolling sidebar which uses
        absolute positioning.</figcaption>
    </p>

    <p>
      Next we have the two stationary elements, fixed and absolute.
      Fixed elements are the simplest to understand as they stay
      in the same place on the page even if the page is scrolled.
      Headers and footers on a page that are always displayed and
      stick in one place as you scroll the page are good examples
      of fixed elements. You position fixed elements using top,
      bottom, left, and right and no gaps in the page are left
      where the element would have been positioned if you'd left
      it as static.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, absolute elements are placed relative to the
      nearest positioned ancestor. In English that means, if you
      have an element that inherits positioning properties from another,
      like "p" from "body", then an absolute positioning of "p" will
      place it stationary on the page relative to the position of
      "body". That means, if there is no ancestor positioning an
      absolute element will use the document body as an ancestor and
      thereby respond to scrolling. Absolute elements are great for
      things you want stationary but to respond to scrolling like
      sidebars.
