**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned quite a bit about border-spacing which I needed to get my tables
to display properly. I used it to be space between the cells.


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**
Getting my pages to be positioned correctly was quite challenging as
using numerous fixed elements, as is needed for a basic template, I
had to constantly guess and check when I wanted to have my main content
have relative positioning.


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**
Getting the navigation bar and the side navigation to behave as a group
was quite simple. Conversely, getting the different elements of the page
to be spaced appropriately relative to one another even when the window
is resized, or the browser is changed, proved quite the challenge. I
still have much to learn about implementing this type of work.


**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**
I learned, that despite my memories of it being otherwise, getting
elements to behave how you want them to is often not straightforward.
Though the elements are all based on a heirarchy, I often couldn't guess
why a particular element wasn't working the way I thought it should.

Also, getting any particular element in CSS to work is greatly helped
if you have a neat HTML file with clearly labeled elements to work
with. I found myself having to constantly go back and rename, and edit the
HTML to editing with CSS even possible.
